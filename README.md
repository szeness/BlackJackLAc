back then I didnt know oop. I learned it at that time tho and implemented it.

tho it was written functional and still is.

just for example the cards I create as objects in arrays and so only as much as picked will be created, and they also know where to place them near the last card.

so that was the first time I realized how amazing the oop is.  

so this was actualy a console game, u still can see it if you press 'V' it will show the console with the by characters drawen cards.. 

then I wanted to implement it in Swing, its my first steps ever to see how in Java a Gui can be operated. beautiful learnings. 

I tried for the first time the location in pixel coordinates to use them for placing ofcourse, but also to use keylistener and to move Labels with pictures around. 
also to code how to colidate dots if they meet the same pixel. yea nothing special very basic thinking but fun.

so there is a car wich u can move with WASD buttons, and if u hit a point it will come an explosion.

also when u win with 21, the car will move by itself every time a bit. and it will hit the explosion point after 10 wins or so maybe less.

its nothing with deaper thoughts, just to see keylistener and the thinking of how to describe the dots meeting and how to describe the radius of the picture size not jsut 
the one dot of it. 

yea so u can play it there is a little credi system inside but in this version its just 500 credit and 50euro bets or so. 

there is another version of this where I for first time implemented a sql database into my program. 
its for login and credit system to be safed. there if you dont login u wont see the game area. and user management had to happen in the sql db. 
 its nice tho not needed , but if comercial would be, its great that know how to do. 

(the same system i then used at my timestamps app, where users can login and start time of work with options wich task to choose. 
And it has a Admin area where can users be registered and edited . also stats about the login times etc admin can see. 
its in Gui Swing aswell. ) Its a cool app check it out in the repros. Tho it wont work prolly because the SQLite Db is not with it I believe.
Gonna fix it later so can dl and check, since the code itself really not beautifuly done. 



not all rules is 100% right, I wasnt aware of them exactly and Double came to it aswell with not exact rules, works fine. 

also not all cards is added, but as far as I remember you cant pull more then 4 of one kind. tho every number is just one time in the pack
